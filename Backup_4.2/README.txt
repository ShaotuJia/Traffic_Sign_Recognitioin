This project is to recongize traffic sign in driving cars. 

Conditions for traffic sign recongintion:

1. Based on traffic sign color in HSV color space.

2. Only blobs whose areas were greater than a fixed precentage of the 
original image area were selected.

3. Blobs are selected if they have an aspect ratio within the range of 
0.6 to 1.4, where aspect ratio is the ratio of height of the blob to its 
width.
